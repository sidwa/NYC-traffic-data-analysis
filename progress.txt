TODO:
-heatmap of accidents.
-visualize on KML.
-consolidate points in proximity and change pin color of points based on num
	accidents in the loc
-find most dangerous spots based on ppl killed or injured.

Done:
found accidents month by month.
more or less the same 
July 2017 has about 300 accidents fewer.

Plotting accidents by time. Most accidents occur during business hours.
oddly most accidents happen at 2pm, Siesta time?

what next:
Find when accidents happen based on cause of accident.

more than 2 vehicles in an accident get quite rare so trying to 
find the time when a pile up is most likely to happen is gonna be
fruit less.

1 vehicle is rarer than 2 vehicles. prob of 2 ppl being careless should
be less but that is compensated by sheer number of vehicles present in
business hours. This along with speed 2 moving entities might be further
increasing chance of accidents.
also both need not be responsible for the accident. 


unique values for number of vehicles involved in accidents.
